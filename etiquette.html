            <h3> 
                Tennis etiquette is an important 
                aspect of tennis as it shows sportsmanship from you and your team. 
                Below are a few concepts and why they matter.

            <h2> SCENARIO: A BALL FROM YOUR COURT ROLLS INTO ANOTHER COURT </h2>
            <p>
                In this scenario, a lot of people just run into the other court to get the ball.
                Many people consider this act uncourteous as it distracts the other courts' players,
                as tennis is mainly a mental game rather than a test of strength and strategy. 
                There are two scenarios in this scenario. One is if the ball rolls to their backcourt. 
                Typically, if the other court isn't scoring an official match, then it is okay to grab the ball 
                from the opponents' backcourt. However, if it rolls to the middle, patiently wait for them to finish the point to rush in and grab the ball.
                Make sure you grab it quickly because the time you take may affect their game too!
